# 3D Pedestrian Detection From Multiple Cameras

This project is part of the Computer Vision course in the Computer Science Bachelor's program at UFRPE. It focuses on detecting pedestrians in 3D using data from multiple cameras. The project uses the [WILDTRACK](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-wildtrack/) dataset and the Reconstructing Groups of People with Hypergraph Relational Reasoning [(GroupRec)](https://github.com/boycehbz/GroupRec) algorithm to extract 3D points from the Seven-Camera HD Dataset images.
